# Executive Summary

## What the Viewer Does Today

This repository contains a browser-based 3D model viewer. It can load and render several common 3D model formats (glTF, OBJ, FBX, etc.) by dragging and dropping local files or loading them from a URL. The viewer is built using `three.js`, loaded directly from a CDN, and requires no build step to run.

**User-Facing Features:**
*   **Model Loading:** Supports loading `.glb`, `.gltf`, `.fbx`, `.obj`, and other formats via drag-and-drop or URL. Includes sample models for quick testing.
*   **Interactive Controls:** Provides standard orbit, zoom, and pan controls, along with camera reset and "fit to view" functions.
*   **Scene Customization:** Allows users to change the background, adjust lighting (ambient and directional), and toggle a ground grid.
*   **Effects:** Includes a "Bloom" post-processing effect.
*   **"Superhero Mode":** A cinematic, non-interactive mode with dynamic camera movements and a theme song.
*   **Export:** Can capture and download a screenshot of the current view.

**Key Limitations:**
*   **No Build System:** The project relies entirely on CDN-hosted scripts, making dependency management, versioning, and modern JavaScript development practices difficult.
*   **Monolithic Codebase:** All application logic is in a single 800+ line JavaScript file (`script.js`), which is difficult to maintain, debug, or extend. The `README.md` claim of "Enterprise-grade code quality" is inaccurate.
*   **No Tests:** The project has no automated tests, making it impossible to verify functionality or prevent regressions.
*   **Misleading Documentation:** The `README.md` is overly promotional and references files (`DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/`) that do not exist.

## Recommended Next Steps (Top 3 Priorities)

1.  **Refactor the Monolithic `script.js`:** Break the single file into a modular structure (e.g., `main.js`, `viewer.js`, `ui.js`) to improve maintainability and enable future development.
2.  **Introduce a Build System:** Implement a modern build tool like Vite or Webpack to manage dependencies from `npm`, bundle the code, and enable modern JavaScript features.
3.  **Update Documentation & Add Tests:** Revise the `README.md` to be accurate and professional. Introduce a testing framework (like Vitest or Jest) and a basic suite of tests to ensure stability.
