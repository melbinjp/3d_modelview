# Verification Checklist

This checklist provides concrete steps for the repository maintainer to confirm the proposed fixes and improvements have been successfully implemented.

### Task 1: Verify Code Refactoring and Build System

**Goal:** Ensure the monolithic `script.js` has been successfully refactored into modules and is being managed by a build tool like Vite.

-   [ ] **1. Check File Structure:**
    -   [ ] The root `script.js` file has been deleted.
    -   [ ] A `src/` directory exists.
    -   [ ] The `src/` directory contains multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `main.js`, `viewer.js`, `ui.js`).

-   [ ] **2. Verify Build Process:**
    -   [ ] A `package.json` file exists with `vite` and `three` listed as dependencies.
    -   [ ] Run `npm install` and confirm it completes without errors.
    -   [ ] Run `npm run dev` (or the equivalent script to start the dev server) and confirm it starts without errors.
    -   [ ] Run `npm run build` and confirm it generates a `dist/` directory with bundled assets (e.g., `index.html`, `assets/index.js`).

-   [ ] **3. Verify Application Functionality (Runtime Check):**
    -   [ ] Open the application in a browser (using the dev server).
    -   [ ] **Action:** Confirm the default "Damaged Helmet" model loads correctly on startup.
    -   [ ] **Action:** Use the "Load Model" button to load another sample model (e.g., the Duck).
    -   [ ] **Action:** Drag and drop a local `.glb` file and confirm it loads.
    -   [ ] **Action:** Toggle the "Bloom" effect and confirm the visual change.
    -   [ ] **Action:** Change the background to "Solid Color" and confirm it updates.
    -   [ ] **Action:** Activate "Superhero Mode" and confirm the cinematic sequence plays.
    -   [ ] **Action:** Check the browser's developer console and ensure there are no new errors.

### Task 2: Verify README Update

**Goal:** Ensure the `README.md` is accurate, professional, and helpful.

-   [ ] **1. Review Content:**
    -   [ ] Read the new `README.md` file.
    -   [ ] Confirm that exaggerated claims ("Enterprise-grade," "Production Ready") have been removed.
    -   [ ] Confirm that broken links (`DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/`) have been removed.
    -   [ ] Verify the presence of a new "Development" section that explains how to run the project with the new build system.
    -   [ ] Verify the presence of a "Deployment" section.

### Task 3: Verify Testing and CI

**Goal:** Ensure a basic testing framework and CI pipeline are in place.

-   [ ] **1. Check for Test Files:**
    -   [ ] A `tests/` directory exists.
    -   [ ] The directory contains at least one test file (e.g., `smoke.spec.js`).

-   [ ] **2. Run Tests Locally:**
    -   [ ] Run `npm test` (or `npm run test:e2e`) and confirm the test suite executes and passes without errors.

-   [ ] **3. Verify CI Pipeline:**
    -   [ ] A `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file exists.
    -   [ ] Open a new Pull Request.
    -   [ ] Go to the "Checks" tab of the PR and confirm that the "CI" workflow was automatically triggered.
    -   [ ] Confirm that all jobs in the workflow (lint, build, test) completed successfully.
