### The Problem

The current `README.md` is inaccurate and sets the wrong expectations for developers.
-   It makes exaggerated claims like "Production Ready" and "Enterprise-grade code quality," which do not reflect the current state of the codebase (monolithic script, no tests, no build system).
-   It contains broken links to non-existent files, specifically `DEPLOYMENT.md` and a `docs/` directory.
-   It lacks crucial information for developers, such as how to set up a development environment or the fact that it relies on CDN-hosted scripts.

A good `README` is the front door to a project. Ours should be clear, honest, and helpful.

### Proposed Solution

The `README.md` should be rewritten to be a factual and helpful guide for both users and developers.

**Plan:**

1.  **Remove Hyperbole:** Remove subjective and exaggerated phrases ("cutting-edge", "Enterprise-grade").
2.  **Fix Broken Links:** Remove the links to `DEPLOYMENT.md` and `docs/`. Add a "Deployment" section directly to the `README` that explains the GitHub Pages process.
3.  **Add a "Development" Section:** Create a new section for developers that explains:
    -   The current architecture (single HTML/JS file, no build step).
    -   The reliance on CDN scripts.
    -   The plan to introduce a build system (linking to the refactoring issue).
4.  **Add a "Roadmap" Section:** Briefly outline the next steps for the project (refactoring, adding tests, etc.) to show that it is under active improvement.
5.  **Clean up Structure:** Reorganize the document to be more logical and easier to read.

### Definition of Done

-   A new `README.md` is committed.
-   All exaggerated claims are removed.
-   All broken links are removed.
-   The new `README.md` contains "Deployment" and "Development" sections.
-   The overall tone is professional, accurate, and helpful.
